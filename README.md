### `About this app`: 
I decided to make a simple copy of the home page of tesla site, to illustrate the power of the JavaScript "Observer" API in a React App, which allows you to take conrol of scroll, by making animations and much more.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
